Scrollio is a jQuery plugin for smooth scrolling on a single page website or web app.

There's still some work to be done, but so far it works!

Scrollio requires two attributes. One being a class of ".scrollio" and a data attribute named "-scroll" with its value being the ID (without the '#') of the section you want to scroll to.
